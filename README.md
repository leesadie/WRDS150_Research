# WRDS 150 - Final Project
WRDS 150A is a foundational research and writing course that I took my first year in the 2022-2023 winter term. Each section of the course has a specific theme that students must conduct research in relation to. My section's theme was nostalgia.

## Summary
This study aimed to understand if the nostalgia trade makes a significant contribution to the Chinese diasporaâ€™s impact on economic growth in Canada, and the channels through which this occurs. Data analysis was performed to understand the effects of economic growth on diasporas and the nostalgia trade.

## Methods
Cross-section regression analyses were performed with R and Jupyter.

See `NDE_Final.ipynb`.

## Results
The Chinese diaspora has generated long-run economic growth in the host country of Canada. Such growth is transmitted primarily by means of increased investment rates and trade openness which includes greater
imports from China, ultimately leading to enhanced economic growth in both countries.
